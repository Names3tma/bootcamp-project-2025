              Hi, my name is <em>Ethan Ma</em> and I am from Newark CA.
              Something things about me is that I enjoy reading{" "}
              <strong>light novels</strong> like Shadow Slave and Lord of the
              Mystery. My favorite subject in Computer Science is something in
              along the lines of AI and cyber security
            </p>

            <p>
              I am a third year transfer at Cal Poly SLO as a CS major. I plan
              on doing my masters as well, don't know where yet.
            </p>
